description: |
  Plots makes it easy to visualise mathematical formulae. In addition to basic
  arithmetic operations, it supports trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential and
  logarithmic functions, as well as arbitrary sums and products. Plots is
  designed to integrate well with the GNOME desktop and takes advantage of
  modern hardware using OpenGL.
