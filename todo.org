* Formula editor
** New features
*** DONE Greek letters (including pi)
*** Logarithms with a base subscript
**** Just make a general subscript class?
*** Subscripts
**** How would they interact with Expt?
*** Sums
*** Products
*** Integrals
*** Derivatives
*** Radicals with an actually visible index
**** UI? Desmos uses 'nthroot' keyword
**** Still need normal square root with no index
*** Absolute value
*** DONE Delete key
*** Mouse
*** Selection - via both keyboard and mouse
**** by finding common ancestor ElementList?
*** Copy and paste
**** Save and restore of equations - related to copy and paste?
**** Could store equations as LaTeX, like Desmos does (at least for copy + paste)
***** Would require conversion to and from LaTeX
**** Might want to use other format, more pythonic perhaps, since integrals in LaTeX a bit ambiguous
***** Sympy compatibility?
*** More international input
*** Keyboard shortcuts (like Geogebra, (maybe) Emacs)
*** DONE Make cursor blink
*** Vectors and matrices
** Refactoring
*** DONE Make formula editor empty by default (but probably still keep a test expression somehow for debugging)
*** Separate classes for numbers and binary operators instead of just using Atom
**** DONE Give binary operators more spacing
*** Separate left and right (and top and bottom?) spacing (primarily for Expt)
**** Is this actually necessary?
*** Make number atoms coalesce?
**** Probably not worth the effort. What advantage does it bring?
*** Remove code duplication for displaying text by using Text
**** Make Paren a subclass of BaseAtom?
*** Split formula.py into separate files
**** Is formula.py really too big? The individual classes aren't really reusable so maybe it doesn't make sense to make them into separate packages.
*** DONE Get Element.font_metrics to give better bounds (use an actual Pango layout? ...like in BaseAtom)
*** Use own copy of font instead of system's
*** Add tests
*** Add type checking/asserts/make everything more robust
*** Add documentation
* Graphing
** via OpenGL (is this definitely faster? offer a cpu calculation option as well?)
** Complex numbers?
** 3D?
** Parametric
** Implicit
** Inequalities
** Polar
** Data/stats?
** Tables of values?
** Discrete distributions? Discrete functions? Piecewise functions?
** Vectors? Vector calculus?
** Matrices? Linear algebra?
** Physical constants?
** Angle units?
* New name - Graphene?
* Icon
* Make the formula editor into a separate widget library
** Make a standalone formula editor?
*** LaTeX output
** Make a scientific calculator?
